 * \brief  MEGA TWI master driver source file.
 *
 *      This file contains the function prototypes and enumerator definitions
 *      for various configuration parameters for the MEGA TWI master driver.
 *
 *      The driver is not intended for size and/or speed critical code, since
 *      most functions are just a few lines of code, and the function call
 *      overhead would decrease code performance. The driver is intended for
 *      rapid prototyping and documentation purposes for getting started with
 *      the MEGA TWI master module.
 *
 *      For size and/or speed critical code, it is recommended to copy the
 *      function contents directly into your application instead of making
 *      a function call.
